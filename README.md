## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Pip**: Package manager for Python.
- **Solana CLI**: Optional, for advanced blockchain interactions.
- **Quantum Simulator**: Optional, for running quantum computations locally.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/osiris-ai.git
   cd osiris-ai
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file with the following content:
   ```
   SOLANA_ENDPOINT=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
   ```

## Usage

### Launching the CLI
Run the CLI tool to execute tasks with Osiris AI:
```bash
python src/main.py --task <task_name> --params '<parameters>'
```

#### Example
Perform Grover’s search:
```bash
python src/main.py --task "grover_search" --params '{"database": [1, 2, 3, 4], "target": 3}'
```
